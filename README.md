# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify movie genres based on their plot summaries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert plot summaries into numerical features.
- Applies **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier for predicting genres.
- Achieves **~58% accuracy** on the test dataset.
- Built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **pandas**.

## 🚀 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- Converted textual data into TF-IDF vectors.
- Trained model on labeled data (movie plots with genres).
- Evaluated performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)


## 📊 Model Used

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
  - Well-suited for text classification problems.
  - Fast and effective on TF-IDF data.

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy: **~58%**
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Try other models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Deep Learning.
- Use word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) instead of TF-IDF.
- Handle multi-label genres (if applicable).
- Tune hyperparameters for better performance.
